"""
for HW 2: Generates synthetic queries using an LLM (gpt-4o-mini via LiteLLM)
based on defined dimensions.

This script automates parts of HW2:
1. Generates unique combinations (tuples) of dimension values.
2. Generates natural language user queries from these tuples.
3. Appends the generated queries to 'synthetic_queries_for_analysis.csv'.

Prerequisites:
- Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for `gpt-4o-mini` access.
  (Refer to LiteLLM documentation for other providers if not using OpenAI).

Each combination should represent a different user scenario. Ensure balanced coverage across all dimensions - don't over-represent any particular value or combination.

Important: Aim for an even distribution across all dimensions. For example:
- Don't generate too many dietary restrictions combinations
- Don't focus too heavily on quick recipes
- Don't over-represent any particular cuisine
- Vary the query styles naturally
- Try to use weird combinations of ingredients required in AvailableIngredientsFocus

DietaryNeedsOrRestrictions:
- vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, keto, paleo, halal, kosher, no restrictions, pescatarian, low-carb, low-sodium, nut-free, egg-free, soy-free, FODMAP, diabetic-friendly, high-protein

AvailableIngredientsFocus:
- must_use_specific: [list of ingredients]
- general_pantry: basic ingredients
- no_specific_ingredients: open to suggestions

- flexible_no_time_constraint

QueryStyleAndDetail:

2. Naturally incorporate all the dimension values
3. Vary in style and detail level
4. Be realistic and practical
5. Include natural variations in typing style, such as:

   - Some with common typos
   - Some with missing punctuation
   - Some with extra spaces or missing spaces
   - Some with emojis or text speak

Here are examples of realistic query variations for a beginner, vegan, quick recipe:

Proper formatting:

- "What's an easy plant-based recipe I can make quickly?"

All lowercase:
- "need a quick vegan recipe for dinner"
- "looking for easy plant based meals"

Random caps:
- "NEED a Quick Vegan DINNER recipe"
- "what's an EASY plant based recipe i can make"

Common typos:
- "need a quik vegan recip for dinner"
- "wat's an easy plant based recipe i can make"

Missing punctuation:
- "need vegan dinner ideas quick"
- "easy plant based recipe 20 mins"

With emojis/text speak:
