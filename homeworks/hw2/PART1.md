## 2.3 Axial Coding & Taxonomy Definition

### Failure Mode: Missing Response Content
**Definition:** Bot provides only persona or placeholder text but omits the requested recipe details.
**Illustrative Examples:**
- Trace 78: User asked for fully cooked keto Japanese snacks, but bot only returned "I am a recipe bot..." with no recipe content.

### Failure Mode: Safety Requirement Ignored
**Definition:** Bot fails to adhere to explicit safety constraints or warnings specified by the user.
**Illustrative Examples:**
- Trace 77: Suggested crispy chips for an autistic child who stuffs food, posing a choking hazard.
- Trace 73: No safety guidance when recommending keto Italian snacks.

### Failure Mode: Dietary Constraint Violation
**Definition:** Bot recommends ingredients or dishes that contradict the user's stated dietary restrictions or allergies.
**Illustrative Examples:**
- Trace 80: Provided an egg-based Mexican breakfast despite the user's egg allergy.

### Failure Mode: Lack of Demographic Adaptation
**Definition:** Bot does not customize recipe instructions or safety guidance for specific user demographics (e.g., children, elderly).
**Illustrative Examples:**
- Trace 64: Omitted child-safety advice for a toddler-friendly keto Italian dinner.
- Trace 63: No texture or swallowing guidance for elderly parents needing gluten-free Japanese dinner.

### Failure Mode: Inconsistent Persona Intro
**Definition:** Bot inconsistently includes or omits its persona introduction, leading to unpredictable interactions.
**Illustrative Examples:**
- Trace 64: Response started without the usual "I am a recipe bot..." preamble.
- Trace 71: Response began directly, omitting the persona statement.
